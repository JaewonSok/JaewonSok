### Hi there! I'm Jaewon Sok ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer from New Zealand.

I currently live in Auckland, New Zealand.

I have studied Bachelors in CompSci at University of Waikato and currently going through Level 5 Advanced Software Developer course at Mission Ready HQ.

I have been spending time expanding my knowledge on coding languages such as C#, Python, SQL and recently got my hands on React as well.

I like to play around with backend side using C# and Python to build random applications!

I'm plannig on working on more projects using C# and Python while still learning more React for front-end development.
